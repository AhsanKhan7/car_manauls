                    <h5>Website Visitors</h5>
                    <p>Like most website operators, Car Manuals Ltd. collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers
                        typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
                        Car Manuals Ltd.'s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Car Manuals Ltd.'s visitors
                        use its website. From time to time, Car Manuals Ltd. may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing
                        a report on trends in the usage of its website.
                    </p>
                    <p>Car Manuals Ltd. also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for
                        users leaving comments on <a href="https://carmanuals.org/">https://carmanuals.org/</a> blog posts. Car Manuals Ltd. only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under
                        the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
